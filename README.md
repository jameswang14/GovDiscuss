GovDiscuss
==========

GovDiscuss is a website that acts a forum for discussion about specific Congressmen and political topics. Using the 
Sunlight Foundation's Congress API, GovDiscuss informs you of your Congressman's recent actions, such as how they voted 
on a certain bill. In addition GovDiscuss features two discussion areas where users can vote on pertinent topics or opinions.

GovDiscuss was first created at the RevoltDC Hackathon in 2013, but has not since been worked on.
